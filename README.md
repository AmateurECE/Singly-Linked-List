# Singly-Linked-List
This is my implementation of a linked list. The header file is the actual implementation, while the .c file is just a test. I didn't do very rigorous tests, because I checked the code with a book that I have after writing it. Coming up next is an iterator for the list and a cool-custom-efficient sorting algorithm that has O(n) or less efficiency. Wow!
